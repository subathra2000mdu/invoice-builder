# React + TypeScript + Vite



## Landing Page - Home page

1) Instant Tool Access: Clicking the "Get Started" button redirects you directly to the invoice creation interface without any intermediary steps.
2) Zero Authentication Required: There is no login or sign-up page; the application is fully functional for guests immediately upon arrival.
3) No Account Management: Users do not need to manage profiles or passwords, ensuring the fastest possible path from landing page to a finished invoice.
4) Direct Navigation: The workflow is designed as a linear progression, moving from the welcome screen straight into data entry.
5) Local-First Privacy: Since no login is required, data is typically processed locally in your session rather than being stored on a permanent remote user account.

## Add Page 
1) Direct Tool Access: Users land directly on the invoice creation page with no login or account registration required to begin.

5) Line Item Entry: Users define individual services or products by entering the Item Name, Quantity, Rate, and Tax %.
6) Dynamic Row Addition: Clicking the blue "+" (Add) button instantly pushes the entered item data into the summary table below.
7) Real-Time Table Rendering: The table displays all added items with columns for Date, Item Name, Qty, Rate, and Total for easy tracking.
8) Action Management: Each row in the table includes an Action column, allowing users to delete or modify entries before finalizing.
9) Form Reset Capability: The interface includes a Reset function (trash icon) to clear all current input fields and start a fresh invoice.
10) PDF Generation: Once the data is verified in the table, the user can trigger a Download PDF action to export a professional document for the client.
